Starter project I wanted to work on to get experience using APIs, 
impove on using python, and create a functional GUI to display info

- Used a geeksforgeeks page as a starter to understand the basic process of how to make an API call along with help from the OpenWeather page itself.

- Noticed the importance of not leaking API keys to Github as API abusers can rack up an abundance of calls which could lead to a balance that someone will have to pay (me in this case).


Ways to improve
- Update the search so that it works with different inputs (zip; city, state)
- Update the display of information to make it more readable
|- Be able to add pictures based on the type of weather
